# Micromouse-NEA-2024
⭐️ This is a repository to store all files and the history for my A-Level Computer Science (OCR) NEA (Non-Exam Assessment) project.

🐁 This NEA aims to simulate micromice - small, automated robots that solve mazes and compete for the fastest time.

🤖 It will simulate the logic and algorithms the mice use as well as the physics of their movement.
